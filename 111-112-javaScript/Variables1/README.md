Declaring Variables in JavaScript.  The first two steps are already done for you as shown on the left.
Declare a JavaScript variable named num and set its value to the integer 1.
Use console.log to output the value of the variable num like this:  console.log("The value of num is " + num);
Declare a JavaScript variable named strName and set its value to your first name (a string literal).
Use console.log to output the value of the variable strName like this: console.log("The value of strName is " + strName);
Declare a JavaScript variable named option and set its value to the JavaScript property null;
Use console.log to output the value of the variable option like this: console.log("The value of option is " + option);
Declare a JavaScript variable named noValue and do not assign it any value.
Use console.log to output the value of the variable noValue like this: console.log("The value of noValue is " + noValue);
Assign to noValue the value of the variable num;
Use console.log to output the value of noValue.
Assign to strName the value of the variable num.
Use console.log to output the value of strName.
Assign to num your first name as a string literal.
Use console.log to output the value of num.
Use console.log to output the value of the variable named novalue (lowercase). This will cause an error message "ReferenceError: novalue is not defined" because the variable name is not correct (the "v" should be capitalized). Fix the error.
Declare a JavaScript variable named document and set its value to the string literal "abc".  This will cause a warning because the word "document" is one of many reserved keywords you cannot use as a variable or function name.
Use console.log to output the value of document.  This will cause something to show that is not the string literal "abc" because document is a keyword representing the structure and information of the web page.
