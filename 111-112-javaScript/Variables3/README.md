1. Declare a variable named myVar1 having the value of 1.
2. Declare a variable named myVar2 having the value of "1".
3. Use console.log to output the text: Comparing 1 and "1" using == is ....  (where ... is the boolean value from the comparison of myVar1 and myVar2).
4. Same as 3. but use the strict equality operator === instead.
5. Assign the empty string "" to myVar1.
6. Assign the value null to myVar2.
7. Use console.log to output the text: Comparing "" and null using == is ....  (where ... is the boolean value from the comparison of myVar1 and myVar2).
8. Same as 7. but use != instead of the == operator.
9. Assign the property undefined to myVar1.
10. Use console.log to output the text: Comparing undefined and null using == is .... (where ... is the boolean value from the comparison of myVar1 and myVar2).
11. Same as 10. but use the strict equality operator === instead.
