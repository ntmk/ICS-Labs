1. Declare a variable m1 and assign to it the value of 100.
2. Declare a variable m2 and assign to it the value of "99" (string).
3. Declare a variable result and assign to it the comparison of m1 greater than m2.
4. Use console.log to output the value of result.
5. Assign to result the value of checking m1 not equal to m2. (not strict inequality).
6. Use console.log to output the value of result.
7. Assign to m1 the value of 99.
8. Assign to result the value of checking m1 equal to m2 using strict equality.
9. Use console.log to output the value of result.
10. Assign to result the logical expression of checking m1 is less than 100 and m2 is greater than 90.
11. Use console.log to output the value of result.
12. Assign to result the logical expression of checking m1 is greater than or equal to m2 or m1 is not equal to 100. (not strict)
13. Use console.log to output the value of result.
14. Use console.log to output the statement from step 12 as a string literal.
15. Using the ternary operator, assign to result the value of "y" if m1 is greater than m2; otherwise, assign the value of "n".
16. Use console.log to output the value of result.. 
17. Use console.log to output the statement from step 15 as a string literal.
