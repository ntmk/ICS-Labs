1. Declare a variable sum and initialize it to zero.
2. Declare a variable count and initialize it to one.
3. Construct a while loop that sums up the numbers from 1 to 20 inclusive using the count and sum variables.
4. Use console.log to output the string: "The sum of the first 20 numbers is ...." where .. is the sum.
5. Reset the value of sum back to zero.
6. Reset the value of count back to one.
7. Construct a while loop that sums up all the even numbers between 1 and 20 inclusive using the count and sum variables.
8. Use console.log to output the string: "The sum of the even numbers between 1 and 20 is ..." where ... is the sum.
9. Reset the value of sum back to zero.
10. Reset the value of count back to one.
11. Construct a while loop that sums up all the numbers between 1 and 100 inclusive that do not contain a 3 or a 7. For example, do not include numbers 3, 7, 13, 17, 23, 27, 30, etc, in the sum.
12. Use console.log to output the string: "The sum of the nice numbers between 1 and 100 is ..." where ... is the sum.
13. Declare a variable wordList and initialize it to the empty string.  Also, declare a loop counter variable i and initialize it to zero.
14. Construct a do while loop that prompts for a secret word continuously until the user enters the word 'quit' or i is greater than 10 ( in other words stop the loop when either the word is 'quit' or the loop counter reaches 10). Increment the loop counter i within the body of the do while loop. Append each secret word entered to the wordList variable each secret word separated by a space. The last word in the word list should be the word 'quit'.
15. Use console.log to output the wordList as "The list of entered words is ..." where ... is the wordList. For example, "The list of entered words is abc xyz quit".
