Part A
1. Write a JavaScript function called calcArea that accepts a number value argument named radius and returns the calculated area of the circle having that radius.  Your function needs to check that the radius value is zero or more to perform the area calculation.  If the radius value is zero or less, then zero should be returned.  Use the Math.PI value in the calculation.  The formula for a circle's area is pi times (radius squared).





2. Write a JavaScript function called calcDistance that accepts four parameters: x1, y1, x2, and y2 representing two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a xy plane.  The function returns the calculated distance between the two points using the distance formula: return the square root of s, where s is the sum of (x2 minus x1) squared and (y2 minus y1) squared.  Use the Math.sqrt and Math.pow functions in the calculation.





Part B

3. Write a JavaScript function called throwTwoDice that has no parameters and returns the sum of rolling two six-sided standard dice.  The dice have six numbers each of equal chance of being rolled: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Check your slide number 7 from module 15 for hints how to do the random number generation.





4. Write a JavaScript function called throwNDice that has one number value parameter named n and returns the sum of rolling n six-sided standard dice.  The calculation should only be performed if the parameter n is between 1 and 6 (e.g. at most six dice are rolled).  Other values of n like zero or anything higher than 6 will cause the function to return zero instead.
